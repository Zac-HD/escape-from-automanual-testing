""" (this file is problem set three of three)


This file contains most of the code for four problems:

- Solving the "water jug problem" from *Die Harder* with stateful testing
- Solving the "Towers of Hanoi" puzzle with stateful testing
- Validating summary statistics for numeric types with metamorphic testing
- Checking graph search algorithms with metamorphic testing

If you're more interested in metamorphic testing, I'd skip down to the statistics
problem and then come back to the water jug problem if you finish early.

# Spoilers at http://nchammas.com/writing/how-not-to-die-hard-with-hypothesis

# In the movie Die Hard with a Vengeance (aka Die Hard 3), there is a famous
# scene where John McClane (Bruce Willis) and Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson)
# have to solve a problem or be blown up: Given a 3 gallon jug and a 5 gallon jug,
# how do you measure out exactly 4 gallons of water?
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cAbgAaEOVE

# We don't have a bomb handy, but we *can* make Hypothesis solve this for us!
# We just need to set up the state and possible actions... then we can claim
# that making random moves never leads to the "solved" state, and let
# Hypothesis find a counter-example.  Fortunately, Hypothesis will also
# shrink what it finds to a minimal sequence of actions!

# This pattern, where all the state lives on the RuleBasedStateMachine,
# is the easiest way to get started with stateful testing.

# Metamorphic testing and statistics demo: how hard can mean() be anyway?

"""How to demonstrate metamorphic testing, without any dependencies?
The technique really shines for larger and more complex systems -
my current favorite example is general tests for RESTful APIs
(http://www.lsi.us.es/~segura/files/papers/segura17-tse.pdf).

So this will be somewhat artificial, sorry.
Hopefully I've convinced you that it's worth trying on real problems though!


Let's do some puzzles with graphs: they're a nice but non-trivial data
structure, and have enough variants that we can solve a problem, make it more
complicated, and then solve it again.

We'll represent graphs as a dict of `{node: {set of (node, cost) tuples}}`.
This representation is a *directed* graph, and allows self-links, but we can
generate examples with neither if that's easier.

I've provided a basic but working implementation of a graphs() strategy,
breadth-first search, and a test that there is a path between any two nodes
(which should pass thanks to the force_path=True argument).
You can expand that test, and then implement one or more of the metamorphic
tests suggested at the bottom of the file.

If you want to keep going with this one, implement edge costs - and good luck!

#    the path from start to mid and mid to end should be the original path.
#    This is the "trust but verify" perspective.
#
# 2. Similarly, forcing the path to go via any point *not* included in
#    the original must lead to a path at least that long.
#    This is a "suspicious" approach to verification.
#
# 3. Irrelevant additions: adding disconnected nodes or components to the
#    graph should not change the result at all.  Nor should linking the
#    midpoint to any new node such that the path from new to end is longer
#    than from midpoint to end (or, symmetrically, for start).
#
# 4. Relevant changes: linking two nodes in the shortest path should drop
#    the nodes between the two newly-linked nodes, but not otherwise change
#    the path.
#
# 5. For undirected graphs, the path from end to start should be the
#    reverse of the path from start to end (accounting for implicit start)
#
# These tests are reasonably quick even for very large graphs,
# where a brute-force search would be infeasible.
#
# So: why not write a test for each based on the stub below?
